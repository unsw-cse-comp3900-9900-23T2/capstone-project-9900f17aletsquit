Week 1

We set up the group and discussed briefly the project topic. As a backend developer, I started to learn Java framework.

Week 2

We had a meeting about the project start-up and the technologies we want to apply for the project. Start to learn springboot.

Week 3

We had several meetings to sort out the detail in the proposal and finished the proposal. 
Discussed the relevant structure of the database with my companions, and decided the main content of the table in mysql.

Week 4

This week, we realized the construction and basic testing of the back-end springboot framework. 
In addition, we also realized the writing and testing of some functions, including: user registration, 
login and logout functions, administrator login and logout functions, sending and writing user 
information functions, and adding, modifying, deleting and querying parking spaces. Based on some 
functions, we have implemented the redis cache, so that all CRUD operations will not be queried from 
the database but extracted from the redis cache, which reduces the consumption of resources.

Week 5
Implement backend functionality: Adding, editing, deleting and querying car spaces.

Week 6
Add all the special queries we need, such as querying all parking spaces, querying parking spaces owned by parking 
space providers, querying unique parking spaces by parking space ID, and querying parking spaces by address.

Week 7
Add a new table to store comment for car space in the database.

Week 8
Implement backend functionality: Adding, editing, deleting and querying orders.

Week 9
Adding enough data to the database.Debugging for the backend. Testing connection 
between frontend and backend.

Week 10
Writing report and readme file.Preparing for the final demo.
