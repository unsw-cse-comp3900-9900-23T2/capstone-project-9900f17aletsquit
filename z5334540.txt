week4:
doing the front-end programing with Chengxuan. The initial page already exists, done most of the initial page jump, but it does not interact with the backend yet. Next week we will interact with the backend and start to plan some functions that need to be implemented by the front end.

week 56:
Finished querying parking spaces, pages for booking parking spaces, and related codes that communicate with the back-end database, but the function of booking parking spaces lacks some restrictions, such as the same parking space can be booked multiple times at the same time. It has also finished citing Google Maps to display the current location, and the parking spaces are displayed on the corresponding Google Maps, and realized keyword query parking spaces, sorted by price and sorted by distance. Completed the initial page of the wallet but still unable to communicate with the backend and database. The My booking page has not yet started. After all the functions of booking parking spaces are completed, we will start to write the My Booking page.
